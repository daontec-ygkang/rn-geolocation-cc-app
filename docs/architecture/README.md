## Key Findings Summary

### ✅ Feasibility: HIGH
The react-native-background-geolocation library **CAN** detect vehicle exit events through a combination of:
- Activity Recognition (IN_VEHICLE → WALKING transitions)
- Motion State Detection (vehicle stopped/parking)
- Location Tracking (distance from parking location)

### 📊 Expected Performance
- **Accuracy**: 85-90%
- **Detection Speed**: <2 seconds
- **Battery Impact**: 5-8% per hour (optimizable)
- **Implementation Time**: 6-8 weeks
- **Complexity**: Medium

### 🎯 Recommended Approach
**State Machine Architecture** combining multiple signals:
```
UNKNOWN → DRIVING → PARKING → EXITED → WALKING/RUNNING
```

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Library installation and configuration
- Permission setup (Android & iOS)
- Basic activity detection

### Phase 2: Core Detection (Weeks 3-4)
- State machine implementation
- Motion and location tracking
- Distance calculations

### Phase 3: UI Integration (Week 5)
- Start/Stop controls
- Activity display
- Real-time updates

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 6-7)
- Background mode
- Battery optimization
- Platform-specific tuning

### Phase 5: Testing (Week 8)
- Real-world testing
- Performance validation
- Bug fixes

---

## Technology Stack

### Core Library
- **react-native-background-geolocation**
  - Activity Recognition API
  - Motion State Detection
  - Location Tracking
  - Background Operation

### Platform Support
- **Android**: API 21+ (Android 5.0+)
  - Google Play Services Location API
  - Activity Recognition API
- **iOS**: iOS 11.0+
  - Core Motion Framework
  - Core Location Framework

### Required Permissions
**Android**:
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION
- ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION

**iOS**:
- NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSMotionUsageDescription

---

## Architecture Highlights

### State Machine Design
```typescript
enum VehicleExitState {
  UNKNOWN = 'unknown',
  DRIVING = 'driving',
  PARKING = 'parking',
  EXITED = 'exited',
  WALKING = 'walking',
  RUNNING = 'running'
}
```

### Key Events
1. **onActivityChange** - Detects activity transitions
2. **onMotionChange** - Detects moving/stationary
3. **onLocation** - Tracks position changes

### Detection Logic
```typescript
// Key transition: PARKING → EXITED
if (activityType === 'walking' &&
    previousState === 'PARKING' &&
    distanceFromParking > 10m &&
    confidence > 60%) {
  transitionTo(EXITED);
}
```

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have
✅ High-confidence activity detection
✅ Parking location tracking
✅ Distance-based exit validation
✅ Background operation support
✅ Battery optimization

### Important
⚠️ Multi-signal validation (reduce false positives)
⚠️ Platform-specific configurations
⚠️ Clear privacy policy for App Store
⚠️ User controls for detection sensitivity

### Nice to Have
- Adaptive sampling based on battery level
- Bluetooth vehicle detection (supplementary)
- Historical activity logging
- Analytics and performance monitoring

---

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **Battery Drain** → Adaptive sampling strategy
2. **False Positives** → Multi-criteria validation
3. **Permission Denial** → Graceful degradation

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Platform Differences** → Platform-specific code paths
2. **GPS Accuracy** → Hybrid detection approach
3. **App Store Approval** → Clear privacy policy

---

## Testing Requirements

### Real-World Testing
- Drive >500m and verify DRIVING state
- Park for 2+ minutes, verify PARKING
- Exit vehicle, walk 20m, verify EXITED → WALKING
- Run 50m, verify RUNNING detection
- Test in background mode
- Test at traffic lights (should not trigger parking)

### Performance Testing
- Battery consumption measurement
- Detection latency tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- False positive rate analysis
