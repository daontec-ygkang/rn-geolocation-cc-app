:   ```typescript
    {
       "timestamp":     [Date],     // <-- Javascript Date instance
       "event":         [String],   // <-- motionchange|geofence|heartbeat

    [## HTTP POST Schema](#http-post-schema)

    The location-data schema POSTed to your server takes the following form:

example
:   ```typescript
    {
        "location": {
            "coords": {
                "latitude":   [Double],
                "longitude":  [Double],
                "accuracy":   [Double],
                "speed":      [Double],
                "heading":    [Double],
                "altitude":   [Double],
                "ellipsoidal_altitude": [Double]
            },
            "extras": {   // <-- optional meta-data
                "foo": "bar"
            },
            "activity": {
                "type": [still|on_foot|walking|running|in_vehicle|on_bicycle|unknown],
                "confidence": [0-100%]
            },
            "geofence": {  // <-- Present only if a geofence was triggered at this location
                "identifier": [String],
                "action": [String ENTER|EXIT]
            },
            "battery": {
                "level": [Double],
                "is_charging": [Boolean]
            },
            "timestamp": [ISO-8601 UTC], // eg:  "2015-05-05T04:31:54.123Z"
            "age":       [Integer],      // <-- Age of the location in milliseconds
            "uuid":      [String],       // <-- Universally unique identifier
            "event"      [String],       // <-- motionchange|geofence|heartbeat
            "is_moving": [Boolean],      // <-- The motion-state when recorded.
            "odometer": [Double/meters]
        }
     }
    ```

### Hierarchy

* [battery]
* [coords]

## Properties

### activity

activity: [MotionActivity]



Device motion-activity when this location was recorded (eg: `still`, `on_foot`, `in_vehicle`).

### age

age: number



The age of the location in milliseconds, relative to the Device system-time when the location was received.
For example, if the reported `age` is `10000`, that location was recorded 10s ago, relative to the system-time.
`location.timestamp` + `location.age` = Device system-time when location was recorded.

### battery

battery: [Battery]



Device battery level when the location was recorded.

### coords

coords: [Coords]



`latitude`, `longitude`, `speed`, `heading`, etc.

### Optional event

event: string



Event responsible for generating this location (`motionchange`, `providerchange`, `geofence`, `heartbeat`).

### Optional extras

extras: [Extras]



Optional arbitrary meta-data attached to this location.

### Optional geofence

geofence: [GeofenceEvent]



If this location was recorded due to a geofence transition, the corresponding geofence-event.

### is\_moving

is\_moving: boolean



`true` if location was recorded while plugin is in the *moving* state.

### Optional mock

mock: boolean



Present (and `true`) if the location was generated by a "Fake Location" application or simulator.

### odometer

odometer: number



Distance-traveled in meters.
ℹ️

* [BackgroundGeolocation.resetOdometer]
* [BackgroundGeolocation.getOdometer]

### Optional provider

provider: [ProviderChangeEvent]



If this location was recorded due to [ProviderChangeEvent], this is a reference to the location-provider state.

### Optional sample

sample: boolean



`true` if the plugin is currently waiting for the best possible location to arrive. Samples are recorded when the plugin is transitioning between motion-states (*moving* vs *stationary*) or [BackgroundGeolocation.getCurrentPosition].
If you're manually posting location to your server, you should not persist these "samples".

### timestamp

timestamp: string



`ISO-8601 UTC` timestamp provided by the native location API.

### uuid

uuid: string



Universally Unique Identifier. You can use this to match locations recorded at your server with those in the logs.
It can also be used to ensure if the plugin has ever posted the same location *twice*.
