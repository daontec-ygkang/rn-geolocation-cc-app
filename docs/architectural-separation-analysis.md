# Architectural Separation Analysis: Motion Detection & Vehicle Exit Detection

## Executive Summary

The current PRD merges two distinct concerns into a single feature: **general motion detection** (walking/running classification) and **vehicle exit detection** (transition from driving to pedestrian state). This analysis proposes a clean architectural separation into two independent, modular features that can work together or separately.

## Current State Analysis

### Feature Entanglement Issues

**Problem**: The PRD conflates two different use cases:
1. **Motion Activity Classification**: Detecting and classifying human locomotion (walking/running)
2. **Transportation State Transition**: Detecting when a user exits a vehicle and begins pedestrian activity

**Current Coupled Architecture** (from PRD lines 79-83):
```
감지 맥락: 모션 감지는 다음 상황 이후 발생하는 활동을 특별히 대상으로 함:
1. 사용자가 운전을 마친 후
2. 사용자가 차량을 주차한 후
3. 사용자가 차량에서 나온 후
```

**Entanglement Evidence**:
- Motion detection is contextually bound to vehicle exit scenarios
- Single UI controls for both features (lines 66-73)
- Shared react-native-background-geolocation configuration
- Mixed responsibility in event handling
- No independent operation capabilities

### React Native Background Geolocation API Analysis

**Available Motion Activities** (from `MotionActivityType`):
- `still` - stationary
- `walking` - pedestrian walking
- `on_foot` - general pedestrian activity
- `running` - pedestrian running
- `on_bicycle` - cycling
- `in_vehicle` - automotive transportation
- `unknown` - unclassified

**Key Events**:
- `onActivityChange` - Motion activity classification changes
- `onMotionChange` - Movement state transitions (moving/stationary)
- `onLocation` - Location updates with activity context

## Proposed Modular Architecture

### Module A: Motion Detection Engine

**Purpose**: Pure motion activity detection and classification

**Responsibilities**:
- Real-time motion activity classification (walking/running)
- Activity confidence scoring and filtering
- Motion pattern analysis and smoothing
- Activity transition detection and validation
- Independent operation without contextual constraints

**Core Interface**:
```typescript
interface MotionDetectionModule {
  // Configuration
  configure(config: MotionDetectionConfig): Promise<void>

  // Lifecycle
  start(): Promise<void>
  stop(): Promise<void>

  // Event subscription
  onActivityDetected(callback: (activity: MotionActivity) => void): Subscription
  onActivityChanged(callback: (activity: MotionActivity) => void): Subscription

  // State query
  getCurrentActivity(): Promise<MotionActivity>
  isActive(): boolean
}

interface MotionDetectionConfig {
  sensitivity: MotionSensitivity
  activityTypes: MotionActivityType[]
  minimumConfidence: number
  smoothingWindow: number
  updateInterval: number
}

interface MotionActivity {
  type: 'walking' | 'running' | 'still' | 'unknown'
  confidence: number
  timestamp: number
  duration: number
}
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Direct `react-native-background-geolocation` integration
- Focus on `onActivityChange` events
- Filter for pedestrian activities: `walking`, `running`, `on_foot`
- Confidence-based activity classification
- Activity smoothing and noise reduction

### Module B: Vehicle Exit Detection Engine

**Purpose**: Detect transition from vehicle to pedestrian state

**Responsibilities**:
- Vehicle presence detection (`in_vehicle` activity monitoring)
- Vehicle exit event detection (transition from `in_vehicle` to pedestrian activities)
- Context-aware state management (driving → parked → exited)
- Integration hooks for triggering other modules
- Transportation mode lifecycle management

**Core Interface**:
```typescript
interface VehicleExitDetectionModule {
  // Configuration
  configure(config: VehicleExitConfig): Promise<void>

  // Lifecycle
  start(): Promise<void>
  stop(): Promise<void>

  // Event subscription
  onVehicleEntered(callback: (event: VehicleEvent) => void): Subscription
  onVehicleExited(callback: (event: VehicleExitEvent) => void): Subscription
  onTransportationStateChanged(callback: (state: TransportationState) => void): Subscription

  // State query
  getCurrentTransportationState(): Promise<TransportationState>
  isInVehicle(): boolean
  isActive(): boolean
}

interface VehicleExitConfig {
  vehicleExitThreshold: number // seconds of non-vehicle activity
  minimumVehicleDuration: number // minimum time in vehicle before exit can be detected
  exitConfirmationDelay: number // delay before confirming exit
  pedestrianActivitiesForExit: MotionActivityType[]
}

interface VehicleExitEvent {
  exitTimestamp: number
  vehicleDuration: number
  location: Location
  nextActivity: MotionActivityType
  confidence: number
}

type TransportationState =
  | 'unknown'
  | 'in_vehicle'
  | 'vehicle_stopping'
  | 'vehicle_parked'
  | 'exited_vehicle'
  | 'pedestrian_active'
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Monitor `in_vehicle` activity state
- Detect transitions from `in_vehicle` to pedestrian activities
- State machine for vehicle lifecycle management
- Location analysis for parking detection
- Integration with motion detection for exit confirmation

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Independent Operation

**Use Case**: Pure motion tracking without vehicle context

```typescript
// Motion Detection Only
const motionDetector = new MotionDetectionModule()
await motionDetector.configure({
  activityTypes: ['walking', 'running'],
  minimumConfidence: 70,
  updateInterval: 2000
})
await motionDetector.start()

motionDetector.onActivityDetected(activity => {
  console.log(`Detected: ${activity.type} (${activity.confidence}%)`)
})
```

### Pattern 2: Triggered Integration

**Use Case**: Start motion detection after vehicle exit

```typescript
// Vehicle Exit Detection + Triggered Motion Detection
const vehicleDetector = new VehicleExitDetectionModule()
const motionDetector = new MotionDetectionModule()

vehicleDetector.onVehicleExited(async (exitEvent) => {
  console.log('Vehicle exited, starting motion detection')
  await motionDetector.start()
})

motionDetector.onActivityDetected(activity => {
  console.log(`Post-driving activity: ${activity.type}`)
})
```

### Pattern 3: Orchestrated Integration

**Use Case**: Coordinated operation with shared UI state

```typescript
// Coordinated Module Operation
class ActivityOrchestrator {
  private vehicleDetector: VehicleExitDetectionModule
  private motionDetector: MotionDetectionModule
  private state: AppState

  async initialize() {
    // Setup vehicle detection
    this.vehicleDetector.onVehicleExited(this.handleVehicleExit)

    // Setup motion detection
    this.motionDetector.onActivityDetected(this.handleActivityDetection)

    await this.vehicleDetector.start()
  }

  private handleVehicleExit = async (event: VehicleExitEvent) => {
    this.state.transportationMode = 'pedestrian'
    await this.motionDetector.start()
    this.notifyUI('Vehicle exit detected - starting motion tracking')
  }

  private handleActivityDetection = (activity: MotionActivity) => {
    this.state.currentActivity = activity
    this.notifyUI(`${activity.type} detected`)
  }
}
```

## Module Interface Definitions

### Shared Types and Constants

```typescript
// Shared motion activity types
export type MotionActivityType = 'walking' | 'running' | 'still' | 'on_foot' | 'on_bicycle' | 'in_vehicle' | 'unknown'

// Common subscription interface
export interface Subscription {
  unsubscribe(): void
}

// Common location interface
export interface Location {
  latitude: number
  longitude: number
  accuracy: number
  timestamp: number
}

// Configuration presets
export const MotionDetectionPresets = {
  HIGH_SENSITIVITY: {
    minimumConfidence: 60,
    updateInterval: 1000,
    smoothingWindow: 3
  },
  BALANCED: {
    minimumConfidence: 70,
    updateInterval: 2000,
    smoothingWindow: 5
  },
  BATTERY_OPTIMIZED: {
    minimumConfidence: 80,
    updateInterval: 5000,
    smoothingWindow: 7
  }
}
```

### Module Communication Interface

```typescript
// Inter-module communication
export interface ModuleEventBus {
  emit(event: string, data: any): void
  on(event: string, callback: (data: any) => void): Subscription
  off(event: string, callback: (data: any) => void): void
}

// Standard module events
export const ModuleEvents = {
  MOTION_ACTIVITY_DETECTED: 'motion:activity_detected',
  MOTION_ACTIVITY_CHANGED: 'motion:activity_changed',
  VEHICLE_ENTERED: 'vehicle:entered',
  VEHICLE_EXITED: 'vehicle:exited',
  TRANSPORTATION_STATE_CHANGED: 'vehicle:state_changed'
}
```
